                <p>
                    Few ideas or theories in the social sciences are conclusively refuted. Instead, social science knowledge often grows by the absorption of contending perspective to existing dichotomies in a field. This process is known as the fractal development of knowledge following Abbott (2001), where competing ideas lead to further differentiation, but chiefly by following existing theoretical dichotomies in a scientific field. The existing quantitative approaches in sociology of science have not yet incorporated the idea of fractality into their toolkit. This thesis aims to fill that gap. I discuss the idea of fractality in relation to existing quantitative approaches. I then offer a new method to visualize absorption and differentiation by tracking the evolution of citation networks over time. To illustrate this new approach, I apply the quantitative-visual method of analysis developed in the thesis to a recent prominent debate in sociology: the secularization debate. The results show that even when a contending camp is refuted, many of the contending authors and some of their ideas find a place in the core set of a citation network, which broadly supports the fractal model of social science knowledge.

            <p>How to distinguish consensus from debate through quantitative analysis in extensive scientific publications?</p>
            <p>The citation network analysis of scientific consensus, the most influential quantitative method for analyzing intellectual debates, faces a dilemma: an approach that is far from constituting the consensus in a scientific field might stay at the core of the citation network for a long period of time and might be influential in shaping new research.</p>

            <h2>Main Idea</h2>
            <p>I propose that if the core of the citation network is fragmenting over time by absorbing a contending camp to a differentiated position within the network, then the field is exhibiting the fractal development of scientific knowledge. As such, the fractal development of scientific knowledge stands in contrast to the view of scientific knowledge where knowledge grows by the exclusion of certain camps over time. </p>
            <p>This outlines the analytical approach of my thesis:</p>

            <h4>2.Identifying the core of scientific debates using cohesive blocking (e.g., the hierarchy in stage 3);</h4>
            <div class="item-name">
                <img src="../images/Figure 7-3 Stage 3.png" alt="Figure 7-3 Stage 3.png">
                <p>Figure 7-3 Stage 3</p>
            </div>

            <p>We apply cohesive blocking analysis to the citation networks of the secularization debate in six stages separately, and the hierarchies obtained are shown in Figure 7.1 - 7.6.</p>

            <h4>3.Tracing the core's evolution across all six phases;</h4>
            
            <p>What this figure shows is the entry and exit of authors in six stages. The vertical axis is the serial number of authors who appear in the core in at least one stage of the debate. The horizontal axis is the stage of the debate. This figure is a matrix with 172 rows and 6 columns. If author i appears in stage j, the element in row i and column j of the matrix is denoted as 1; otherwise, it is denoted as 0. The light colors in the diagram correspond to 1, and the dark colors correspond to 0. For example, the author of line 0 (it’s Peter Berger) appeared in the core of all six stages, so a continuous, light-colored horizontal line appears; The author of line 18 appeared only in the first stage of the debate, so only the first column in row 18 is light, followed by dark color. Reading the figure from left to right, we can see the authors moving in and out of the core: light to dark means the author is out, and dark to light means the core has a newcomer.</p>
            <div class="item-name">
                <img src="../images/Figure 7-7 Authors' entry and exit matrix.png" alt="Figure 7-7 Authors' entry and exit matrix.png">
                <p>Figure 7-7 Authors' entry and exit matrix</p>
            </div>

            <p>One of the most basic findings is that at each stage a large proportion of authors exit and a large proportion enter as newcomers, and the core turnover is high. This turnover suggests that the discussion of secularization has remained active rather than forming a thoroughly crystallized core. Second, a certain proportion of newcomers in each stage (authors who have never entered the core before) will stay in the core in the later stages, indicating that newcomers breed new followers, often because they put forward new theoretical paths or theoretical positions. Third, the authors withdrew from the core not because the theoretical path they represented was completely denied and excluded. Rather, because the size of the core is limited (the size of the core remains relatively stable over the six phases), subsequent researchers will try to merge previously similar paths as much as possible to simplify the discussion and incorporate emerging theoretical paths.</p>


            <h4>4.Visualizing co-citation  networks to clearly observe the core's transformation (e.g., the co-citation network in stage 2 and stage 3);</h4>

            </div>
            

            <p>We visualize the co-citation network in the six stages as follows. In these figures, green nodes indicate that these nodes have appeared in previous stages (by default, all green nodes in the first stage), while red nodes indicate that this node has appeared for the first time in this stage and is a newcomer, representing a new theoretical path or position. The size of the node represents the weight of the node, that is, the sum of the weights of all adjacent ties. The Yifan-Hu layout applied in the figure is a force-directed algorithm that assumes that there is a repulsive force between the nodes, but the ties provide an attractive force for the nodes. In a weighted network, the greater the weight of a tie, the greater the attractive force. In the layout formed by this algorithm, the closer the node is to the center, the stronger the co-citation relationship with other nodes, and the more core position it occupies in the network.</p>

            <h4>5.Discussing the methodological advantages over existing approaches.</h4>
            <p>Our study provides a way to find consensus in scientific debates where winning and losing are unclear. The previous maximum modularity method and other community detection algorithms try to block the citation network, but because of the ambiguity of the reference relationship, this block sometimes cannot represent the debate and consensus effectively. We conducted a community detection analysis of the six stages of the secularization debate, and the result is unsatisfactory.</p>
            <p>We performed the Girvan-Newman algorithm (Girvan and Newman 2002) on the author-citation network of secularization debate. This method is similar to Shwed and Bearman’s (2010), which blocks the network by maximizing its modularity. The higher the modularity degree is, the better the result of network segmentation is. Because higher modularity means the connections within modules are denser than those outside modules. According to Shwed and Bearman, the change of modularity from high to low means the shift from debate to consensus. The analysis results of this method are as follows.</p>
            <div class="item-name">
                <img src="../images/Figure 8-1 Temporal Modularity.png" alt="Figure 8-1 Temporal Modularity">
                <p>Figure 8-1 Temporal Modularity</p>
            </div>

            <p>The modularity shown in the figure remains stable at a very low level (all below 0.03), indicating that the partitioning is not successful and there is little difference between inside and outside the module. Furthermore, the tendency of modularity to change is contrary to the results of qualitative analysis. When theorists argue, measures of modularity show that they form a consensus, and vice versa.</p>
            <p>The purpose of method comparison is not to falsify the study of Shwed and Bearman. After all, our network composition is different, and the algorithms and data used are not exactly the same. What we want to convey is an expectation to explore the complexity of scientific debate and consensus formation: there may be more structural features of scientific debate waiting to be discovered. </p>

                <h3>Fractal differentiation</h3>
                <p>Social sciences are rarely characterized by exclusive refutation of particular ideas and propositions. New topics, theories, and methods are constantly acquired, but seldom lost. This makes these disciplines “irremediably interstitial”(Abbott 2001). In interstitial disciplines, new positions (whether related to topic, theory, or method) do not gain dominance by negating or eliminating other positions but by remapping existing positions in relation to their claims. With the increase of new positions and the lack of mechanisms to exclude them, the scientific fields tend toward greater differentiation over time. Abbott refers to this contextualized repositioning as “indexicality”, and the self-similarity of differentiation within and outside the domain as “fractal distinctions”. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Secularization debate</h3>
                <p> The empirical case I choose to illustrate this analysis is the secularization debate in the sociology of religion. In this debate, the dichotomy of secularization and non-secularization was itself contested by questioning the veracity of the dichotomy at the national, organizational, and individual levels. A fundamental reason for choosing the secularization debate is that the process of absorption and differentiation has been well-documented through qualitative by leading authorities within sociology of religion (Chaves 1994; Dobbelaere 1985; Edgell 2012; Gorski and Altınordu 2008; Tschannen 1991; William Jr and Christiano 1999). In this debate, the contenders were the authors advocating a rational choice theory of religion and defending the position that religion should be studied through the concept of religious economy. The attack against the secularization notion, a central idea in sociology of religion since the 1960s, was a key vector of attack against the incumbents by the contending rational choice approach to religion. The contending camp was popular in the 1990s and they managed to attract a significant amount of initial attention. However, over time, both the rational choice approach to religion and the notion of religious economy ended up being rejected by many authoritative figures and most practitioners in the sociology of religion (Norris and Inglehart 2011). However, as noted by qualitative reviews (Edgell 2012; Gorski and Altınordu 2008), the religious economy model (REM) is still cited in various secularization studies and it still has adherents. This is consistent with the model of fractal development of scientific knowledge. As such, I expect to find patterns of this fractality in the structure of the citation network over time, as described in the previous paragraphs. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="concept">
                <h3>Cohesive blocking</h3>
                <p>Cohesive blocking (Moody and White 2003) is an algorithm for identifying cohesive groups defined by k-connectivity. This gives us a way to address the core of the debates. This method emphasizes, above all, the recognition of the connection between authors. In subgroups with high k-connectivity, the connections between nodes (authors) are more resilient and robust, meaning that although people in the entire field of debate may switch opinions at any time, or selectively choose to cite certain authors’ work because of the aspects that they involve, the underlying academic connection between these authors is maintained. In other words, associations between authors in cohesive subgroups are not dependent on one or more authors and hence have are robust.</p>
                <p>Further, cohesive blocking can result in nested hierarchies, with connectivity as the dividing criterion. As Moody and White illustrate: “Identification involves a recursive process: One first identifies the k-connectivity of an input graph, then removes the k-cutset(s) that hold(s) the network together. One then repeats this procedure on the resulting subgraphs, until no further cutting can be done. As such, any (k+l)-connected set embedded within the network will be identified. Moreover, each iteration of the procedure takes us deeper into the network, as weakly connected nodes are removed first, leaving stronger and stronger connected sets, uncovering the nested structure of cohesion in a network.”(Moody and White 2003:109)</p>
                <p>Note that the k-cutset is the set of nodes for which their removal will disconnect the network. It should also be noted that the removal of particular nodes implies the removal of edges connecting these nodes to the rest of the network. </p>
                <p>The cohesive subgroups produced by iterative removal get higher and higher k-connectivity. In the citation network, the authors in the most cohesive subgroup, that is, the authors at the highest level in the hierarchy, are actually the authors whose centrality are recognized by most authors in the network. This recognition emerges from the fact that if a sufficient number of authors cite the author, then these citations relationships establish independent paths between the cited author and all the authors in the citation network. Hence, whether the citation is for support, criticism, introduction, evidence, or simply because of an attractive motto, the cited author becomes a part of a robust citation network. For instance, suppose an author from the incumbent camp cites a leading author in the contending camp. That immediately establishes an independent path between many authors in the incumbent camp and the leading figure in the contending camp, even when these authors do not directly cite the leading figure in the contending camp. That is because the author from the incumbent camp citing the leading figure in the contending camp is likely to cite many other authors in the incumbent camp.</p>
                <p>The most cohesive subgroups identified by the cohesive blocking method have strong internal connectivity, and this connectivity implies non-vulnerability and common recognition, which are the characteristics at the core of the debate.</p>
